# We do link against musl-static to get the string functions.  But we
# carefully use hidden visibility for these so they have no PLT entries.
# The compiler inlines memcpy et al as builtins and then (often)
# generates calls to those same functions as an implementaiton detail of
# its builtins; those generated calls use PLT entries.  Using the
# -ffreestanding switch would tell the compiler not to inline memcpy et
# al, so the explicit calls in the source would respect the hidden
# visibility we used to declare them.  However, even with -ffreestanding
# the compiler can generate calls to memcpy, memset, etc. on its own.
# If the compiler generates a call to (e.g. memcpy) in a translation
# unit where there was no explicit call to that symbol, it won't emit
# the .hidden marker in the assembly for the symbol, meaning the linker
# will generate a PLT entry and relocation for it, which we cannot
# allow.  So don't bother with -ffreestanding, since it doesn't solve
# the problem anyway and some inlining might be beneficial.  Instead
# feed every translation unit a header file that stuffs some .hidden
# declarations into the assembly to cover symbols compilers might use.
